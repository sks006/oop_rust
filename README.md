# Rust OOP Concepts

> 📚 A practical guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns in Rust  
> 🦀 Language: Rust | 🧠 Learning Style: Rule-based, Syntax-Driven | 🎯 Focus: Why + How

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is a **learning project** that demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming concepts can be expressed idiomatically in Rust. While Rust is **not class-based** like JavaScript or C++, it supports many OOP principles such as **encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction** through traits, structs, enums, and lifetimes.

## 📘 Topics Covered

| # | Topic | Rust Feature | OOP Principle |
|---|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Structs + impl | `struct`, `impl` blocks | Encapsulation |
| 2 | Traits + Trait Bounds | `trait`, `impl<T: Trait>` | Polymorphism |
| 3 | Trait Objects | `dyn Trait`, `Box<dyn Trait>` | Dynamic Dispatch |
| 4 | Composition | Structs inside Structs | "Has-A" Relationship |
| 5 | Abstract Classes | Traits + default impls | Abstraction |
| 6 | Builder Pattern | Method chaining | Fluent interfaces |
| 7 | State Pattern | Enums + Trait Objects | Behavior encapsulation |
